So, here we are. Presenting: **[the yolo page â†’](https://thesephist.github.io/yolo/)**

On the yolo page, **anything goes**. This is a public GitHub repository, and I'll merge any pull request you make. But there are some ground rules:

## Rules!

1. No spamming, advertising, or simply deleting other people's work
1. No potential security issues -- e.g. no random third-party scripts
1. Please try not to hide/move this rules section or the contributors section below :) but you're free to improve it!

You can see much more on the actual site ^^
